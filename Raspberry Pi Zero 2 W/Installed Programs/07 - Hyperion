# Hyperion
Used to sync smart lights to picture on display. Far cheaper alternative to the Hue Sync Box (~$300).
## Parts List
* [USB 2.0 1080p 30Hz Capture Card](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08F6ZD2RK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [HDMI Splitter, 1-in-2-out, 4k 60Hz Simultaneous Output](https://a.co/d/fNABOwW)
* 3 HDMI Cables

Total cost: ~$50 <br><br>
One HDMI cable will go from the input device (e.g., PS5 or PC) to the input port of the HDMI splitter. This is so it can output it’s video feed to both the monitor/tv and the Raspberry Pi simultaneously (that’s why we need two output ports on the splitter). The second HDMI cable will be connected from one of the output ports of the splitter to the monitor/tv. The third HDMI cable will be connected from the other output port of the splitter to the USB Capture Card, and the USB Capture Card will then be connected to the Raspberry Pi.
## Installation
1. First we import the public key from Hyperion:
    ```
    wget -qO- https://apt.hyperion-project.org/hyperion.pub.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hyperion.pub.gpg
    ```
2. After that we enter Hyperion-Project as source of Hyperion:
    ```
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hyperion.pub.gpg] https://apt.hyperion-project.org/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hyperion.list
    ```
3. Lastly, we update the package list and install Hyperion:
    ```
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install hyperion
    ```
## Configuration
Once, Hyperion is installed on the pi, you can access the Hyperion website using `[PIIPADDRESS]:8090`. 
1. Go to LED Instances > LED Output, and choose the controller type depending on your smart lights (e.g., philipshue), then proceed with the setup.
2. Go to Capturing Hardware and activate the USB Capture option.
3. To reduce the delay captured, I suggest changing device resolution to 640x480 and FPS to 30.
<br><br>
If you want to make it so it turns off when it detects rainbow bars, use the following settings under `Capturing Hardware`,
* Signal detection - checked
* Red signal threshold - 0
* Green signal threshold - 100
* Blue signal threshold - 0
* Signal Counter Threshold - 200
* Signal Detection VMin - 0
* Signal Detection VMax - 1
* Signal Detection HMin - 0.4
* Signal Detection HMax - 0.45
