# Uninstalled Programs

The programs were uninstalled from my Pi.

1. [Rclone](/Raspberry%20Pi%204/Uninstalled%20Programs/01%20-%20Rclone.md)
1. [Grafana](/Raspberry%20Pi%204/Uninstalled%20Programs/02%20-%20Grafana.md)
1. [AltServer](/Raspberry%20Pi%204/Uninstalled%20Programs/03%20-%20AltServer.md)

On Windows, use PuTTY. On Mac, use Termius. They will be used to SSH into the Pi and install/uninstall everything. <br>
When you SSH into the Pi, the default username is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`.
